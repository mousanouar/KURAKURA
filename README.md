Kuramoto model simulations for the Intro to Complex Systems course in Utrecht university.

Codes are ordered as follows: 

#1: Simulation of 10 runs to get evolution of order parameter as a function of time, with each iteration having same frequency distribution.

#2: Same as above, but with fixed initial phases of oscillators and a different frequency distribution at each run.

#3: Simulation to determine r(inf) vs K and K_c for a normal frequency distribution (and specific r(t) for K=1 and K=2).

#4: Simulation to determine r(inf) vs K and K_c for a uniform frequency distribution.

#5: Simulation for a Kuramoto model on Watts Strogatz network. Determination of K_c vs p.
